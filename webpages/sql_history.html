    <h2>LET US LEARN ABOUT HISTORY OF SQL</h2>
    <p>Structured Query Language, abbreviated as SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables.
        SQL offers two main advantages over older read write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. <br> Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, e.g. with or without an index.
        Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of many types of statements,]which may be informally classed as sublanguages, <br> commonly: a data query language (DQL), <br> a data definition language (DDL), br
        a data control language (DCL), and a data manipulation language(DML).The scope of SQL includes data query,<br> ata manipulation (insert, update, and delete), data definition (schema creation and modification), and data access control. Although SQL is essentially a declarative language (4GL), it also includes procedural elements.
        SQL was one of the first commercial languages to use Edgar F. Codd’s relational model. The model was described in his influential 1970 paper, "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks".Despite not entirely adhering to the relational model as described by Codd, it became the most widely used database language.
        SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986 and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.Since then, the standard has been revised to include a larger set of features. Despite the existence of standards, most SQL code requires at least some changes before being ported to different database systems. <br>
        SQL was initially developed at IBM by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce after learning about the relational model from Edgar F. Codd in the early 1970s.This version, initially called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language), was designed to manipulate and retrieve data stored in IBM's original quasirelational database management system, System R, which a group at IBM San Jose Research Laboratory had developed during the 1970s.
Chamberlin and Boyce's first attempt at a relational database language was SQUARE (Specifying Queries in A Relational Environment), but it was difficult to use due to subscript/superscript notation. After moving to the San Jose Research Laboratory in 1973, they began work on a sequel to SQUARE.The original name SEQUEL, which is widely regarded as a pun on QUEL, the query language of Ingres,was later changed to SQL (dropping the vowels) because "SEQUEL" was a trademark of the UK-based Hawker SiddeleyDynamics Engineering Limited company. The label SQL later became the acronym for Structured Query Language.
After testing SQL at customer test sites to determine the usefulness and practicality of the system, IBM began developing commercial products based on their System R prototype, including System/38, SQL/DS, and IBM Db2, which were commercially available in 1979, 1981, and 1983, respectively.
In the late 1970s, Relational Software, Inc. (now Oracle Corporation) saw the potential of the concepts described by Codd, Chamberlin, and Boyce, and developed their own SQL-based RDBMS with aspirations of selling it to the U.S. Navy, Central Intelligence Agency, and other U.S. government agencies. In June 1979, Relational Software introduced one of the first commercially available implementations of SQL, Oracle V2 (Version2) for VAX computers.
By 1986, ANSI and ISO standThe SQL language is subdivided into several language elements, including:
•	Clauses, which are constituent components of statements and queries. (In some cases, these are optional.) <br>
•	Expressions, which can produce either scalar values, or tablesconsisting of columns and rows of data <br>
•	Predicates, which specify conditions that can be evaluated to SQL three-valued logic (3VL) (true/false/unknown) or Booleantruth values and are used to limit the effects of statements and queries, or to change program flow. <br>
•	Queries, which retrieve the data based on specific criteria. This is an important element of SQL. <br>
•	Statements, which may have a persistent effect on schemata and data, or may control transactions, program flow, connections, sessions, or diagnostics. <br>
o	SQL statements also include the semicolon (";") statement terminator. Though not required on every platform, it is defined as a standard part of the SQL grammar. <br>
•	Insignificant whitespace is generally ignored in SQL statements and queries, making it easier to format SQL code for readability. <br>
ard groups officially adopted the standard "Database Language SQL" language definition. New versions of the standard were published in 1989, 1992, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2006, 2008, 2011,[12] and most recently, 2016. <br> <br>
